  This is where there would be a paragraph, assumsing that the author actually
  wrote anything at all. That's not to say the author doesn't write anything -
  he has; he just has not made anything public just yet. Maybe that would be
  something he could work on in his freetime. Who knows? The world is his
  oyster!
