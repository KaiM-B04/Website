      This is where there would be a paragraph, assumsing that the author
      actually wrote anything at all. That's not to say the author doesn't write
      anything - he has; he just has not made anything public just yet. Maybe
      that would be something he could work on in his freetime. Who knows? The
      world is his oyster!
