        Well, I (aka Kai) am currently working on a writing project in between
        thinking about codes, which doesn't have a name as of yet. It will be a
        short story or a small novel about a post apocalyptic world where none
        of the main characters special or important. <br />
        In fact, all the major heroes of the world will be observed through the
        lens of the main character, who is an avarage Joe, named Joe. Joe isn't
        really good at anything, and doesn't have the stamina, intelligence or
        coordination to be a hero of their harsh world.
