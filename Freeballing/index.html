      <h3>Hello and welcome to the site that will become the Kodehode baby!</h3>
      <p class="Intro">
        There's not much to see here, and I have no idea how you even stumbled
        across this page in the first place, but you're here, so let's talk!<br />
        What can you be expected to see here in the future? Well, I (aka Kai) am
        currently working on a writing project in between thinking about codes,
        which doesn't have a name as of yet. It will be a short story or a small
        novel about a post apocalyptic world where none of the main characters
        neither special nor important. <br />
        In fact, all the major heroes of the world will be observed through the
        lense of the main character, who is an avarage Joe, named Joe. Joe isn't
        really good at anything, and doesn't have the stamina, intelligence or
        coordination to be a hero of their harsh world.<br />
        Sound interesting? Why don't you have a read!
