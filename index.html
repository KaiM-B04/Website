              There's not much to see here, and I have no idea how you even stumbled across this page in the first place, but you're here, so let's talk!
            </p>
            <p>What can you be expected to see here in the future?</p>
            <p>
              Well, I (aka Kai) am currently working on a writing project in
              between thinking about codes, which doesn't have a name as of yet.
              It will be a short story or a small novel about a post apocalyptic
              world where none of the main characters are special or important.
              <br />
              In fact, all the major heroes of the world will be observed through
              the lens of the main character, who is an avarage Joe, named Joe.
              Joe isn't really good at anything, and doesn't have the stamina,
              intelligence or coordination to be a hero of their harsh world.
