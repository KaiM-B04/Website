          There's not much to see here, and I have no idea how you even stumbled
          across this page in the first place, but you're here, so let's talk!

          Well, I (aka Kai) am currently working on a writing project in between
          thinking about codes, which doesn't have a name as of yet. It will be
          a short story or a small novel about a post apocalyptic world where
          none of the main characters are special or important. <br />
          In fact, all the major heroes of the world will be observed through
          the lens of the main character, who is an avarage Joe, named Joe. Joe
          isn't really good at anything, and doesn't have the stamina,
          intelligence or coordination to be a hero of their harsh world.
